# Data-Visualisation

This folder contains the HTML document index.html and 15 csv files (for performance statistics for the years 2003-2017)


## Summary 

This visualisation aims to explore the on time performances of various american carriers through the years 2003-2017. 
In addition on selecting a specific year and carrier a second chart illustrates the distribution for that specific carrier (delayed, on time, cancelled) 

## Design

The main aim was to create an illustration showing the comparison of on time performances of various american carriers for the years 2003-2007. For this I chose to use bar charts with the values displayed on top of the bar chart. In addition i used a drop down widget for 
enabling the user to select the desired year.  

My initial design (index_1.html)  contained only the bar chart graph and after obtaining feedback I chose to include a second chart 
(pie-chart) which illustrated the statistics for a specific carrier in a given year. While hovering with the mouse on a bar would reflect the changes in the pie-chart.  Also I changed the color code to google style which was a bit more pleasing.

•	  What do you notice in the visualization?

I can see the on time performance of various American carriers and their values for various years 

•	What questions do you have about the data?

How is the on time performance defined?  How was the data collection process performed? Did all Airlines report the statistics in a similar way?

•	What relationships do you notice?

I have the impression that the performance of the airlines has improved over the years but some airlines also have disappeared from the market 

•	What do you think is the main takeaway from this visualization?

It is possible to compare the on time performances of various carriers throughout the span of 15 years 

•	Is there something you don’t understand in the graphic?

Not really, The visualisation is quite self-explaining but I would recommend a second chart which illustrates some key characteristics for a specific carrier
