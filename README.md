# Data-Visualisation

This folder contains the HTML document index.html and 15 csv files (for performance statistics for the years 2003-2017)


## Summary 

This visualisation aims to explore the on time performances of various american carriers through the years 2003-2017. 
In addition on selecting a specific year and carrier a second chart illustrates the distribution for that specific carrier (delayed, on time, cancelled) 

## Design

The main aim was to create an illustration showing the comparison of on time performances of various american carriers for the years 2003-2007. For this I chose to use bar charts with the values displayed on top of the bar chart. In addition i used a drop down widget for 
enabling the user to select the desired year.  

My initial design (index_1.html)  contained only the bar chart graph and after obtaining feedback I chose to include a second chart 
(pie-chart) which illustrated the statistics for a specific carrier in a given year. While hovering with the mouse on a bar would reflect the changes in the pie-chart.  Also I changed the color code to google style which was a bit more pleasing.

•	  What do you notice in the visualization?

I can see the on time performance of various American carriers and their values for various years 

•	What questions do you have about the data?

How is the on time performance defined?  How was the data collection process performed? Did all Airlines report the statistics in a similar way?

•	What relationships do you notice?

I have the impression that the performance of the airlines has improved over the years but some airlines also have disappeared from the market 

•	What do you think is the main takeaway from this visualization?

It is possible to compare the on time performances of various carriers throughout the span of 15 years 

•	Is there something you don’t understand in the graphic?

Not really, The visualisation is quite self-explaining but I would recommend a second chart which illustrates some key characteristics for a specific carrier

•	What do you notice in the visualization?

I’m not 100% sure what you exactly mean by that. Do you mean what information I see? Well, that would be the performance of different American carriers measured by some number (above the bars) and categorizing deliveries by “on time”, “delayed” and “cancelled” over time.

•	What questions do you have about the data?

What do the numbers above the bars say? Has the amount of carriers decreased or increased? What about the amount of deliveries? How big is the market share of each carrier? This information would be helpful to interpret the data.

•	What relationships do you notice?

The number above the bars seems to correlate with the percentage of on-time deliveries. So I guess it is a measure for the performance (maybe customer satisfaction).

•	What do you think is the main takeaway from this visualization?

I would say that the overall performance is on time for all carriers. Looking at the development over time I would say that it was a booming market from 2003 to ~2009 with an increasing variety of American carriers. After that it seems that that a few carriers established themselves and the rest got outperformed. The overall performance does not change much, at least at first glance. Maybe a little increase over time, but usually around ~0.8.

•	Is there something you don’t understand in the graphic?

Not really. It is pretty straightforward.
