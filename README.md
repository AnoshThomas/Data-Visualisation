# Data-Visualisation

This folder contains the HTML document index.html and 15 csv files (for performance statistcis for the years 2003-2017)


## Summary 

This visualisation aims to explore the on time performances of various american carriers through the years 2003-2017. 
In addition on selecting a specific year and carrier a second chart illustrates the distribution for that specific carrier (delayed, on time, cancelled) 

## Design

The main aim was to create an illustration showing the comparison of on time performances of various american carriers for the years 2003-2007. For this I chose to use bar charts with the values displayed on top of the bar chart. In addition i used a drop down widget for 
enabling the user to select the desired year.  

My initial design (index_1.html)  contained only the bar chart graph and after obtaining feedback I chose to incldue a second chart 
(pie-chart) which illustrated the statistics for a specific carrier in a given year. While hovering with the mouse on a bar woudl reflect the changes in the pie-chart.  Also I changed the color code to google style whcih was a bit more pleasing.
